# Open-Google-Petition Google Respect Account Holder Privacy



## Dear G-Team, I have been a reasonable & responsible G-mail accounts holder and honest paying customer through G-mail for 10+ years anniversary and am disappointed to see this <1 year old account suddenly become "disabled." I receive invoices, including from my bank lawsuit payouts to me and updates from TurboTax news, and I pay my bills through Gmail, so I created this new account because of recent inconvenience of diminishing mailbox space to forward carbon copies of my financial records. We just had a conversation with a friend with real life disability on Voice.google and read yesterday Ray Kurzweil head of Google's prestigious department of innovations invented accessibility devices for the blind. We use Gmail to pay Venture Capitalists in Silicon Valley. I use Gmail to send money to my political leaders in Democratic across cities in America because of the work they do for us in public service. It is unfortunate this "disabled" terminology is being used on my new account where I feel disrespected as a decade long email holder, friend and donor to disabled people's causes (1/4 millions of Americans loosely qualify) who only writes messages within warm friendship contacts circles and see no life harming policy from Google has been transgressed other than my own personal privacy, potential financial records of my transactions, and donations to respectable, verified and charitable causes. If Gmail is freely using citizens and taxpayer accounts to send invoices, bills, bank promotionals, legal notices, donations and unsolicited marketing emails from real hackers, censorship of citizens who are paid, pay, and play fairly by rules for the past 10+ years should be given serious consideration
